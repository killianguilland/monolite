# Monolite

Monolite is two things in one :
- a style reset to unify browser rendering.
- a set of reusable elements (details below)

It is meant to help you build clean websites before you start implementing a graphics chart.

**It is still in very early development.**

## Installation

Just include the stylesheets and script and you will be ready to go !
